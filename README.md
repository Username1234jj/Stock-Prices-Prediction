This project predicts future stock prices using historical data and machine learning models. It helps to understand how stock market data can be analyzed and used to forecast trends.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to use stock price data (like Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume) to build a machine learning model that can predict future stock prices. It shows how time series data is handled and how models can learn from past patterns.

## Features

- Load and analyze historical stock price data  
- Visualize stock price trends over time  
- Prepare and scale data for training  
- Build and train a prediction model (Linear Regression, LSTM, etc.)  
- Predict future prices based on trained data  
- Plot real vs predicted stock prices for comparison  

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow / Keras (for deep learning models)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Dataset

You can use any stock market dataset that contains the following columns:
```
Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
```

You can download stock data from **Yahoo Finance**, **Kaggle**, or **Google Finance**.  
Example: Download Apple’s stock data from Yahoo Finance and save it as `AAPL.csv` in the `data/` folder.

## Project Structure

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Username1234jj/Stock-Prices-Prediction.git
   cd Stock-Prices-Prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies  
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Make sure your dataset file (e.g., `AAPL.csv`) is in the `data/` folder.

## How to Run

**To run using Python script:**
```
python stock_prediction.py
```

**To run using Jupyter Notebook:**
```
jupyter notebook Stock_Prices_Prediction.ipynb
```

Run all cells step by step to see data loading, model training, and prediction results.

## How It Works

1. Load the stock price dataset  
2. Perform data cleaning and visualization  
3. Scale and split data into training and testing sets  
4. Train a regression or LSTM model to predict stock prices  
5. Compare actual vs predicted prices using graphs  

## Example Output

The model will show predicted stock price trends alongside the actual prices.

```
Date          Actual Price     Predicted Price
2024-01-10        150.23              149.85
2024-01-11        151.76              152.10
2024-01-12        153.20              153.05
```

And a graph comparing the two curves:
```

```

## Future Improvements

- Try different models like Random Forest, ARIMA, or Prophet  
- Add technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI) for better prediction  
- Use multiple stocks for portfolio forecasting  
- Build a Streamlit or Flask web app for interactive prediction  
- Deploy the model as an API or web dashboard
